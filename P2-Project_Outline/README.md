## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will be a single website that works as a interactive "guess the country's flag" game. It'll be useful and entertaining in helping the user learn various countries' flags and, if I do implement this feature, the geographical location of said country through Google Maps API. The idea came from wanting to work with an API and as I was thinking of booking a flight.

### Features
Main Display: The application should be able to display a flag. 
Random Flag Generator: The user should be able to press a button to change to another random flag. 
Input Field: The user will be able to enter their answer. 
Input Validation: The application should be able to check that answer and display correct or incorrect. 
Clear Button: The user should be able to clear the input field. 
Timer: The application should have a timer and the user should guess as many countries in the allotted time. 
Score: Application should keep track of the score.
